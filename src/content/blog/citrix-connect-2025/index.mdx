First thanks to my exployer [Danoffice IT](https://danofficeit.com) for sponsoring my trip to Citrix Connect 2025 in London. \
It was a great experience and I learned a lot about the future of Citrix, how to secure and optimize a Citrix environment and meet awesome customers, partners and Citrix employees.

-----

My trip started from Aalborg Airport where started my four hour journey to London, first on SK1214 and then SK1507. I arrived at the hotel in the evening and where some of my colleagues already had checked in. \
The next day, the conference started with a keynote from Brian Madden, who shared Citrix's vision and strategy for the future.
