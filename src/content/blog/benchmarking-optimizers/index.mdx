I have always been wondering what the difference is between the various VDI optimizers, so I decided to do a little benchmarking of the three most popular ones: VODT, Citrix Optimizer, and VMware OS Optimization Tool.
I used the same Windows 11 image for all three optimizers, and I ran the optimizers with their default settings. The results were quite interesting, and I will share them here.
I use Azure as the hosting platform, there might be a slight difference in the results due to it been on a hyperscaler but I think it is still a good comparison.
